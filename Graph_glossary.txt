# Vertex - One of the two (together with edges) basic units out of which graphs are constructed.
# Edge - One of the two (together with vertices) basic units out of which graphs are constructed. Each edge has two vertices to which it is attached, called its endpoints. In the program edges considered to be directed, which are also called arcs or arrows.
# Connectivity matrix - A matrix whose rows and columns are both indexed by vertices of the graph, with a 1 in the cell for row i and column j when vertices i and j are connected, and a 0 otherwise.
# Connectivity list - A computer representation of graphs for use in graph algorithms.
# Path - A walk(sequence of vertices which are joined by a sequence of edges) without repeated vertices.
# Path length - A number of edges through which the path passes.
# DFS - An algorithm for graph searching. The algorithm starts at the root vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
# BFS - An algorithm for graph searching. The algorithm starts at the root vertex and explores all vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at the next depth level.
# Strongly connected graph - A directed graph, where there is a path in each direction between each pair of vertices of the graph.
# Weakly connected graph - A directed graph in which replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph.
